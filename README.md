>> AND HE HAS.

LEGENDARY OLYMPIC DREAM TEAM IN

ADDITION TO AN NBA COMEBACK, BUT
SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.027 align:middle line:90%
MORE THAN BASKETBALL.

>> IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE
MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.078 align:middle line:90%
COMMUNITY.
>> BUT HE STILL HAS A HAND IN

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.214 align:middle line:90%
THE WORLD OF SPORTS.
HE WAS PRESIDENT OF BASKETBALL

MAGIC JOHNSON, SO GOOD TO SEE

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:17.811 align:middle line:90%
YOU.
>> YOU TOO CRAIG.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.679 align:middle line:90%
>> LET'S TALK.
YOU LIVE OUT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.849 align:middle line:90%
AS YOU KNOW, THEY JUST PASSED
THIS LAW OUT THERE THAT WOULD

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.186 align:middle line:90%
ALLOW COLLEGE ATHLETES TO GET
PAID FOR ENDORSEMENTS, MAKE

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:29.723 align:middle line:90%
MONEY OFF THEIR LIKENESS, THEY
CAN HIRE AGENTS, YOU PLAYED IN

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:33.593 align:middle line:90%
WHAT'S STILL THE MOST WATCHED
COLLEGE BASKETBALL GAME IN

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.429 align:middle line:90%
HISTORY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
MICHIGAN STATE, INDIANA STATE,

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.301 align:middle line:90%
YOU AND LARRY BYRD.
DID YOU THINK WHEN THAT LAW

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.903 align:middle line:90%
PASSED, I COULD HAVE CASHED IN.
>> LARRY AND I COULD HAVE CASHED

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.841 align:middle line:90%
IN AFTER THAT GAME, OF COURSE,
BUT THE LAW IS GOOD, I THINK,

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.644 align:middle line:90%
FOR THE PLAYERS, THE ATHLETES,
THE STUDENT ATHLETES, BECAUSE

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.881 align:middle line:90%
LISTEN, YOU DON'T MAKE ANY
MONEY, YOU CAN'T GET A JOB WHILE

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.484 align:middle line:90%
YOU'RE PLAYING AT YOUR
UNIVERSITY, SO THIS ALLOWS THEM

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:02.288 align:middle line:90%
TO AT LEAST HAVE A LITTLE MONEY
IN THEIR POCKET TO ENJOY COLLEGE

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.291 align:middle line:90%
AND ENJOY JUST GOING OUT TO
DINNER AND LUNCH OR TAKING THEIR

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.228 align:middle line:90%
GIRLFRIEND TO A MOVIE.
>> SO YOU THINK ALL COLLEGE

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.429 align:middle line:90%
ATHLETES SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE
PAID.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.298 align:middle line:90%
>> I THINK SO.
AND LISTEN, WE'RE NOT TALKING

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.968 align:middle line:90%
ABOUT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS, BUT JUST ENOUGH FOR

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:19.706 align:middle line:90%
THEM TO HAVE A GREAT LIFE WHILE
THEY'RE ON CAMPUS.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.708 align:middle line:90%
>> I WANT TO CLEAR UP SOME
CONFUSION WHY YOU'RE HERE,

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.511 align:middle line:90%
RECENTLY I TALKED TO YOUR BOY,
MICHAEL JORDAN, AND I ASKED HIM

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:28.481 align:middle line:90%
A QUESTION, FIRST OF ALL, I
ASKED HIM LIKE ON HIS BEST FIVE

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:32.085 align:middle line:90%
ALL TIME, WHO'S ON HIS TEAM, HE
PICKED YOU OF COURSE, YOU'RE ONE

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.087 align:middle line:90%
OF HIS FIVE AND THEN HE SAID
SOMETHING ELSE THAT MADE SOME

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:38.525 align:middle line:90%
NEWS, TAKE A LISTEN.
>> WHEN I'M GOING IN THE

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.861 align:middle line:90%
TRENCHES, I PLAYED AGAINST AND
WITH ALL OF THESE GUYS, I'M

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:45.365 align:middle line:90%
GOING WITH WHO I KNOW.
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, THAT

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:49.169 align:middle line:90%
RESPONSIBILITY TO GO OUT THERE
AND REPRESENT GREATNESS EVERY

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.504 align:middle line:90%
SINGLE NIGHT.
>> STEPH CURRY SHOULDN'T BE

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
OFFENDED WHEN HE WATCHES.
>> I HOPE NOT.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:90%
HE'S STILL A GREAT PLAYER.
NOT A HALL OF FAMER YET, THOUGH.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.613 align:middle line:90%
>> NOT A HALL OF FAMER.
AND THEN SO YOU TWEETED LIKE TWO

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:90%
DAYS LATER, I WANT TO PUT THE
TWEET UP FOR OUR VIEWERS AT

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.685 align:middle line:90%
HOME.
EVERYONE RELAX, WE KNOW STEPH

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:10.056 align:middle line:90%
CURRY IS A FUTURE HALL OF FAMER,
MICHAEL JORDAN COULDN'T SAY IT

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.258 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE HE WOULD GET FINED BY
THE LEAGUE.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:15.895 align:middle line:90%
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT, THE
LEAGUE THAT SENSITIVE.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.598 align:middle line:90%
>> MICHAEL JORDAN IS THE OWNER.
CHARLOTTE, HE OWNS THE TEAM, AND

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:24.137 align:middle line:90%
SO IF HE HAD SAID GREAT COMMENTS
ABOUT STEPH CURRY, THE OTHER

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:28.608 align:middle line:90%
OWNERS WOULD THINK THAT HE'S
RECRUITING HIM TO COME PLAY FOR

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:32.078 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL SO MICHAEL COULDN'T SAY
IT.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:34.814 align:middle line:90%
BUT WE KNOW STEPH CURRY IS A
FUTURE HALL OF FAMER.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.484 align:middle line:90%
THE GREATEST SHOOTER WE HAVE
EVER SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:39.619 align:middle line:90%
NBA.
>> IN THE HISTORY OF THE LEAGUE,

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.556 align:middle line:90%
STEPH CURRY.
>> STEPH CURRY, KLAY THOMPSON,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.359 align:middle line:90%
THE TWO GUYS PLAYING ON THE SAME
TEAM WITH REGGIE MILLER, RAY

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.796 align:middle line:90%
ALLEN AND LARRY BYRD.
>> GLAD YOU CLEANED THAT UP.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.499 align:middle line:90%
>> I THINK STEPH IS THE BEST.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.968 align:middle line:90%
ELSE THAT'S BEEN IN THE
HEADLINES A LOT LATELY, THE

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:55.969 align:middle line:90%
LEAGUE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH
CHINA.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.771 align:middle line:90%
AS YOU KNOW, THE GENERAL
MANAGER.

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.906 align:middle line:90%
>> RIGHT.
>> OF THE HOUSTON ROCKETS A FEW

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.575 align:middle line:90%
WEEKS AGO HE TWEETS OUT
BASICALLY SUPPORTING THE

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:06.546 align:middle line:90%
PROTESTERS IN HONG KONG, CHINA
THEN PUNISHES THE LEAGUE, AND

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:11.217 align:middle line:90%
NOW YOU'VE GOT A RELATIONSHIP, A
POTENTIALLY MULTIBILLION DOLLAR

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.485 align:middle line:90%
RELATIONSHIP THAT'S HANGING IN
THE BALANCE.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle line:90%
HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE ISSUE OF
GLOBAL FREEDOM WITH THE BUSINESS

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.460 align:middle line:90%
INTERESTS OF THE NBA.
>> WELL, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.331 align:middle line:90%
FIRST, EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A
RIGHT TO, YOU KNOW, FREEDOM OF

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.366 align:middle line:90%
SPEECH.
AND I'M FOR FREEDOM FOR ALL

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:32.906 align:middle line:90%
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE FIGHTING
ENOUGH OF THAT RIGHT HERE IN

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.808 align:middle line:90%
AMERICA FOR MINORITIES.
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABOUT MY

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:90%
WHOLE LIFE.
NOW I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT THE

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:90%
GREATEST COMMISSIONER, AND ADAM
WOLF FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, A

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.452 align:middle line:90%
SOLUTION TO THIS.
AND I THINK THAT ALL THE PLAYERS

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:49.189 align:middle line:90%
ARE PUTTING THEIR TRUST AND THE
OWNERS ARE PUTTING THEIR TRUST

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.461 align:middle line:90%
IN ADAM SILVER, AND I THINK
HE'LL DELIVER A SOLUTION.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.097 align:middle line:90%
IT'S ALL ABOUT A SOLUTION.
WE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM, BUT

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:59.899 align:middle line:90%
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SOLUTION.
>> HOW DO YOU THINK THE LEAGUE

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.836 align:middle line:90%
HANDLED IT SO FAR?
>> IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION.

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:05.839 align:middle line:90%
THERE'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, YOU
KNOW, AT STAKE HERE, SO I THINK

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.676 align:middle line:90%
EVERYBODY WHO WAS CAUGHT OFF
GUARD, AND IT'S NOTHING THAT,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:90%
LISTEN, YOU'RE PUTTING THE
PLAYERS IN A TOUGH POSITION,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.116 align:middle line:90%
LeBRON HAS BEEN PUT IN A TOUGH
POSITION.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:19.052 align:middle line:90%
ADAM SILVER HAS BEEN PUT IN A
TOUGH POSITION.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:26.693 align:middle line:90%
NOW I THINK THEY HAVE TO COME
TOGETHER, PLAYERS, OWNERS AND AM

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.161 align:middle line:90%
D
-- ADAM NEED TO COME UP WITH A

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.331 align:middle line:90%
SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO BE
LEAGUE, FOR PEOPLE IN HONG KONG

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.099 align:middle line:90%
AND CHINA.
>> HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S 28 YEARS

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.436 align:middle line:90%
AGO ROUGHLY AROUND THIS TIME
THAT YOU TOLD THE WORLD THAT YOU

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.105 align:middle line:90%
WERE LIVING WITH HIV.
IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD YOU THEN

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:43.309 align:middle line:90%
THAT NOT ONLY WOULD YOU BE ALIVE
TODAY BUT YOU WOULD BE THRIVING

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:48.481 align:middle line:90%
IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD,
WOULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED THEM?

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NO.
28 YEARS AGO, ONE DRUG, A.C.T.,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.758 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS A DEATH SENTENCE AT THAT
TIME, AND HERE I AM, 28 YEARS

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.026 align:middle line:90%
LATER, AS YOU'RE SAYING, HAVING
A GREAT LIFE.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:90%
I WORK OUT EVERY DAY.
I MAKE SURE THAT I'M EATING THE

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.434 align:middle line:90%
RIGHT FOODS AND ALSO, TOO, MY
ATTITUDE AND MINDSET REALLY

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:11.304 align:middle line:90%
HELPED OUT AS WELL.
>> WHAT'S THE ATTITUDE AND

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.539 align:middle line:90%
MINDSET.
>> I THINK JUST ACCEPTING YOUR

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.041 align:middle line:90%
NEW STATUS AND BEING COMFORTABLE
WITH IT.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.845 align:middle line:90%
AND I ACCEPTED THAT AND THEN I
HAD TO TALK TO MY DOCTORS AND

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.814 align:middle line:90%
SAY HOW CAN I BE HERE A LONG
TIME.

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:24.484 align:middle line:90%
AND THEY TOLD ME, TAKE MY MEDS,
BE COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR STATUS

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:28.388 align:middle line:90%
BUT ALSO YOU GOT TO WORK OUT.
SO I'VE BEEN DOING THOSE THINGS.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle line:90%

IN THE 90s FOLKS WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT IT.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:42.402 align:middle line:90%
DO YOU HAVE FOLKS COMING UP ON

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.107 align:middle line:90%
CREDIT.
SHE HELPED ME.

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:51.911 align:middle line:90%
SHE DIED A YEAR LATER OR TWO OF
AIDS BUT SHE'S THE ONE WHO MADE

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.849 align:middle line:90%
MYSELF COMFORTABLE AND MY WIFE
COOKIE COMFORTABLE AND SHE JUST

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.286 align:middle line:90%
